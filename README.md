# C-from-zero-to-hero

This repository contains a C file named **"LearnCFromZero.c"** that I created while I was trying to learn the C programming language. It contains my C notes, which is more than **800 lines of code**.

The **"C notes1"** folder contains **45 .c files** and **.exe files** of them, that I created while I was trying to learn the C programming language.
